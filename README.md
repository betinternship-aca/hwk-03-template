  - *lastIndexOf*
    should return the last index of item in the given array and return -1 if item doesn't exist in that array.
    shouldn't use any native method for lookup.
  - *getRandomInt*

    shouldn't use any method other than Math.random()
  - *getRandomMatrix
    should return a matrix filled with random integers from [1, 100).
  - *matrixIndexOf*
    should return the index of an item in the matrix. index should be returned as array `[number, number]` or as object `{i: number, j: number}`. should return null if the item doesn't exist in the matrix.
  - *matrixLastIndexOf*
    should do the same but return the last index of item if there is many.
  - *equals*
    should return true if objects have equal properties. should return true for the same primitive value also.
    your code should contain no more than one loop (for code reuse).
